# Password Generator

## Description
This application can help you to generate a strong password. 

### What means strong password?

The key aspect of a strong password is length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Letters should not be words from the dictionary and should not be connected to your personal information.
